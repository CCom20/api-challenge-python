## Part I - WeatherPy

This project looks at temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed across various latitudes and longitudes. Scatter plots and linear regression look at whether there is correlation between latitude and any of the mentioned variables. Within the `weatherpy.ipynb` file, there are comments and observations.

Some overall observations: 
* There is a high correlation between Latitude and Temperature, noteably that temperature increase as latitude approaches 0-degrees.
* There is no correlation between Latitude and: Cloudiness, Wind. 
* At the time the dataset was pulled, there was weak correlation between Latitude and Humidity.


## Part 2 - VacationPy

This project considers some "ideal" weather conditions and looks at only the areas that match those conditions. It also includes a heatmap where the density is set to the humidity, the darker the red, the greater the humidity. For the spots that match ideal weather conditions, markers were placed. 

Observations: 
* Most of the vacation spots are around the equator.
