## Part I - WeatherPy

This project looks at temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed across various latitudes and longitudes. Scatter plots and linear regression look at whether there is correlation between latitude and any of the mentioned variables. Within the `weatherpy.ipynb` file, there are comments and observations.

Some overall observations: 
* There is a high correlation between Latitude and Temperature, noteably that temperature increase as latitude approaches 0-degrees.
* There is no correlation between Latitude and: Cloudiness, Wind. 
* At the time the dataset was pulled, there was weak correlation between Latitude and Humidity.


## Part 2 - VacationPy


* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
